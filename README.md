# Sleep-Analysis-ML

# Project description

The project studies how sleep duration and quality change day-by-day, and how behavior during the previous day affects sleep. The sleep-related factors such as caffeine consumption, activity or stress could have a big impact on sleep. The objective of this project is to find patterns in sleep quality by examining relationshops between sleep and other factors.

# Description of the dataset

The dataset contains sleep-related information that was collected by Dana Diotte between the years 2014 – 2018. Data is Diotte’s personal data from the Sleep Cycle application form Northcube. The dataset was published on the website Kaggle.com.
There are in total 887 observations from different days. There are no observations from each day, but from those days that there are, the dataset is well-filled as there is not too much missing data. Ten variables were tracked: Start, End, Sleep quality, Time in bed, Wake up, Sleep Notes, Heart rate, and Activity. The dataset is in .csv format.

# Conclusions
TBA
